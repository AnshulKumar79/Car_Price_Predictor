# Car_Price_Predictor
Creating a Car Price prediction model using Linear Regression machine learning algorithm.
Car Price Predictor

This project is a simple web application that predicts the price of a used car based on its features.

The prediction model is built using a Linear Regression algorithm from scikit-learn and the app is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.

🚀 Live Demo

📋 Features

The model uses the following features to predict the car's price:

Year: The manufacturing year of the car.

Kilometers Driven: The total distance the car has traveled (in km).

Fuel Type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG, LPG, etc).

Seller Type: The type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer).

Transmission: The transmission type (Manual or Automatic).

Owner: The ownership history (e.g., First Owner, Second Owner).

🛠️ Technology Stack

Python: The core programming language.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the Linear Regression model.

Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.

Streamlit: For creating and deploying the web application.
